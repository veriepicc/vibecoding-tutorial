# How to Vibe Code: A Simple Guide

## A Note for Programmers Who Hate This Idea

If you're a programmer, the idea of "vibe coding" might sound lazy or even offensive. You've spent years honing your craft, and now you're being told to let an AI do all the work.

Hear me out. This isn't about replacing your skills; it's about upgrading them. It's about letting go of the tedious, manual parts of coding so you can focus on what really matters: the architecture, the user experience, and the creative vision. You have to learn to trust the AI, to treat it not as a dumb tool, but as a capable partner. Let go of your instinct to control every line of code.

## The Big Idea: Be the Brain, Not the Keyboard

Forget syntax. Forget boilerplate. Your job is to have the *vision*. The "vibe."

You think **what** to build. The AI handles **how**.

It's like walking. You don't think about every muscle. You just decide to walk, and your body handles the rest. Here, you're the mind, and the AI is the body that writes the code.

## The Vibe Coder's Tools

This process doesn't work by just copying and pasting from a chatbot website. You need the right environment.

### Tool #1: Use a Proper AI Editor (Cursor)

We are not using a generic web interface like ChatGPT or Gemini.com. We are using **Cursor**, an editor built specifically for this kind of AI-powered development.

This is non-negotiable. Why? Because Cursor gives the AI **full system access**.
- It can read files.
- It can write and edit code directly.
- It can create and delete files.
- It can run terminal commands.

Without this, you're just a glorified copy-paster. With it, the AI becomes a true extension of your will, capable of building and managing an entire project on its own.

### Tool #2: Use the Right AI for the Job (Model Switching)

For one of our most complex requests (fixing physics, controls, *and* implementing an infinite world), you "swapped" me (Gemini 2.5 Pro) for a more powerful model ("GPT-5-High"). This is a crucial skill.

It's not about one AI being "smarter." It's about knowing which tool to grab for which task. Use a fast, creative model for most of the work, but don't be afraid to switch to a heavy-duty model for the really tangled problems.

### Tool #3: Nuke and Pave, Don't Bicker (Regenerate, Don't Fix)

When an AI messes up, don't try to fix its code line by line. You'll get stuck in a frustrating loop.

The better way is to **re-prompt**. If the physics are wrong, just say, "The physics are too fast." Let the AI take a fresh shot at the problem. It's almost always faster and cleaner than trying to patch a bad implementation.

**Rule of thumb: If the code is more than a little bit wrong, just nuke it. Give a better prompt and regenerate.**

## A Real-World Example: Our Game

Let's look at how *you* did it. This isn't theory; this is what actually happened.

### Request #1: The Spark
> "lets make a 2d web game... a minecraft terraria mix..."

Perfect. You gave me the *feeling* of the game, not a list of files to create. I handled the boring setup; you stayed focused on the vision.

### Request #2: The Bug Report
> "the player is bugging up and down and shaking like crazy..."

You didn't look for the bug. You just described what you *saw*. This is the way. Tell the AI the symptom, and let it find the cure.

### Request #3: The "Kitchen Sink" Prompt
> "the phyiscs are too fast, and the controls are messed up... implement infinite world generation..."

You bundled three huge problems into one and correctly identified that it was time to switch to a more powerful AI model to solve it.

## The Result of Good Vibes

This is what we made, just by talking. No code written by you, just pure vision, executed by an AI in the right environment.

You're a natural at this because you're treating the AI as a partner. You trust it, you guide it, and you focus on the big picture. That's the secret. That's vibe coding.
